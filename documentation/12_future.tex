\section{Conclusions}
In summary, this paper proposes a method to compute cost-oriented charge schedules for large numbers of battery electric buses by dividing the charge problem into several sub-problems which focus on energy placement, group separation, defragmentation, bus-to-charger assignment, and cost optimization.
