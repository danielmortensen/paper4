\section{Conclusions}
In summary, this paper proposes a method to compute cost-oriented charge schedules for large numbers of battery electric buses by dividing the charge problem into several sub-problems which focus on energy placement and group separation, charge session length and assignment, and cost optimization. The proposed method has been shown to scale well as both the runtime and monthly cost increase linearly with the number of buses. 
Furthermore, because the proposed method contains a number of sub-problems, setting the optimization criteria for each sub-problem gives the user flexability so that the proposed method can be adapated to solve a variety of scenarios and optimization preferences.
