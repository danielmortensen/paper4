First, the targeted problem is formulated using a two-stage optimization approach. The first-stage decisions determine the amount of import/export energy from the external grid at each hour, as well as energy exchanges for each {ESS}. The second stage deals with the intra-day control, given the first stage decisions. In order to effectively consider the impacts of uncertainties, the problem is transformed into a ‘min-max-min’ formulation. Here, we minimize the first (day-ahead scheduling) and second stage (intra-day operation) costs while uncertainties are maximally affecting the cost function of the second stage. The Benders dual cut algorithm is employed for the solution of the optimization problem. {IEEE} 34 bus standard network is the benchmark grid for assessing the performances and effectiveness of the developed robust optimization process.},

This complex problem needs a robust, fast, and powerful optimization algorithm, which is able to extract the Pareto-optimal surface ({POS}).

The introduction of energy storage system in the electric vehicle charging station can alleviate negative impacts of station operation on the utility grid and reduce the distribution transformer capacity, which brings obvious economic benefit. However, due to the uncertain factors, such as the randomness of fluctuations, the capacity configuration of energy storage systems is necessary. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a capacity configuration optimization approach for the energy storage system in the charging station considering load uncertainty. Taking into account the investment and expanding capacity reconstruction cost and the annual electricity cost, the cost model of the energy storage system with the variable life of the battery is established and solved by robust optimization. Compared with the optimized configuration strategy based on the definite load curve, the proposed configuration strategy based on load uncertainty has shown satisfactory stability and robust performance.},

The traditional stochastic optimization and robust optimization methods may result in over-conservative or overrisky decisions when dealing with the uncertainty of wind power and load. Therefore, this paper proposes a distributionally robust optimization model for the decomposition of contract electricity, which regards the difference between the unit's monthly power generation and the contract electricity as one of its optimization target. This model includes not only the units, wind turbine, but also the electrical storage system. Then, based on the typical scenario data of wind power and load, and the regulation characteristics for different decision variables, a data-driven based two-stage distributionally robust reactive power optimization model is set up, in which the uncertainty probability distribution confidence set is simultaneously constrained by 1-{QRUP} {DQG} norm.

	abstract = {Active power dispatch and reactive power optimization problems are usually handled separately in active distribution systems, aiming at minimizing the total generation cost or transmission losses. However, the separate optimization cannot achieve a global optimum scheme in distribution system operations. Moreover, the signiﬁcant relationship between the active power and reactive power may pose great challenges to distribution system operations due to the uncertain nature of load demands and intermittent renewable energy resources. In this paper, using the branch ﬂow model-based relaxed optimal power ﬂow, we formulate a robust coordinated optimization problem for active and reactive powers as a mixed integer second-order cone ({SOC}) programming problem. Furthermore, in order to address the uncertainties, a two-stage robust optimization model is proposed to coordinate the on load tap changer ratios, reactive power compensators, and charge–discharge power of energy storage system to ﬁnd a robust optimal solution. Then the column-and-constraint generation algorithm is applied to solve the proposed robust two-stage optimization model. In the relaxed optimal power ﬂow, a stricter cut is added to speed up the computation process of the {SOC} relaxation in order to guarantee the exactness for representative cases, such as those with high penetration of distributed energy resources. Numerical results based on the 33-bus and 69-bus systems verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Due to the environmental issues that arise from the emissions of polluting gases produced by fossil-fueled electric power plants, it becomes the environmental/economic dispatch ({EED}) multi-objective optimization problem. {EED} problems have been most commonly solved using deterministic models (without considering uncertainties). In this context, a robust model to cope with uncertainties is necessary, because the deterministic model is not able to reﬂect some real condition in practical applications, since fuel cost and emission coefﬁcients may be subjected to inaccuracies, for instance. In this paper, both deterministic and robust {EED} problem models are ﬁrst formulated, and a Robust Evolutionary Optimization Algorithm - {REOA} is proposed. For the robust model, the worst case scenario is estimated, to ﬁnd reliable solutions that are still feasible and have a good performance under the action of parametric uncertainties. Comparative studies are carried out to examine the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Simulation results are presented for the standard {IEEE} 30-bus system.

In this context, this paper proposes an adaptive robust optimization model for the generation and transmission expansion planning problem. The proposed model has a two-stage structure that separates investment and operational decisions, over a given planning horizon. The key attribute of this model is the representation of daily operational uncertainty through the concept of representative days and the design of uncertainty sets that determine load and renewable power over such days. This setup allows an effective representation of the ﬂexibility requirements of a system with large shares of variable renewable energy, and the consideration of a broad range of operational conditions. To efﬁciently solve the problem, the column and constraint generation method is employed. Extensive computational experiments on a 20-bus and a 149-bus representation of the Chilean power system over a 20-year horizon show the computational efﬁciency of the proposed approach, and the advantages as compared to a deterministic model with representative days, due to an effective spatial placement of both variable resources and ﬂexible resources.},

In this way, D-{RERD} inherits the advantages from both stochastic optimization and robust optimization: statistical characteristic is taken into account in a data-driven manner without requiring the exact pdf of uncertain factors.

A local search algorithm called Nelder-Mead is combined with {BF} technique to improve optimization procedure for fully exploiting the promising solution region. In the design procedure the nonlinear constraints such as Generation Rate Constraint ({GRC}) will be also taken into account. Comparative results of the proposed control strategy and other intelligent methods, {CRAZYPSO} and {BF}, reveal the effectiveness of this new technique in terms of reducing settling time, overshoot and oscillations.},

	abstract = {{MG}) operation such as output power of renewable energy sources ({RESs}), electricity price and load demand. Ignoring these existing uncertainties in the optimization problem imposes high cost to the system and the lack of reliability. This paper presents a general linear framework for microgrid optimization problem using robust optimization method. Adaptive robust optimization ({ARO}) model is a min-max-min problem in which the first level targets to determine the on/off status of dispatchable units, the second one aims find the worst case of uncertain parameters and eventually in third level the operational costs are minimized. This model is converted to a min-max one by using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker ({KKT}) conditions and then the ensuing model is linearized. A control parameter named budget of uncertainty is considered to determine the level of robustness and being conservative. The more budget of uncertainty we consider, the more robust model we obtain. An optimum point in which the expected cost is minimal and a compromise between the level of robustness and operational cost is reached. A modified {IEEE}-33 bus system is considered to evaluate the adequacy of proposed linear {ARO} model. Simulation results prove that the proposed {ARO} model is appropriately able to deal with the existing uncertainties and results in lower expected cost compared to deterministic model.},

Also, the day-ahead dynamic prices are derived to mitigate charging impacts on power distribution systems. This problem is formulated as a distributionally robust Markov decision process ({DRMDP}) with uncertain transition probabilities and costs to address the impacts of random bus loads with inaccurate probability density function estimation. An event-based ambiguity set with combined statistical distance and moment information is developed to achieve minimax-regret criteria for less-conservative and robust solutions. To facilitate practical applications with reduced computational complexity, a heuristic regret function is proposed, based on which the dynamic prices are derived. Case studies based on {EB} data from St. Albert Transit and {IEEE} test feeders indicate that the proposed method can minimize {EB} charging cost with mitigated impacts on power distribution systems.},

	abstract = {The optimal engine operating zone of energy management plays an important role in the fuel economy improvement of Plug-in hybrid electric buses. However, the existing investigations usually design the engine operating zone by experience. This paper proposes a robust design method for the robust and optimal design of the engine operating zone. Firstly, a nonlinear model predictive control ({NMPC})-based energy management together with a single-point preview {SOC} (state of charge) plan method is designed. Then, a Taguchi robust design model is designed to ﬁnd the optimal engine operating zone by taking the energy management as underlying solving module. Particularly, the noises of driving cycles and stochastic vehicle mass are considered to improve the robust performance of the engine operating zone. Finally, The Monte Carlo Simulation is deployed to verify the robustness and optimal performances of the designed engine operating zone. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is beneﬁcial to the fuel economy improvement, where the fuel economy can be averagely improved by 9.10\% compared with the experienced designed engine operating zone, and can be averagely improved by 16.34\% compared with the rule-based energy management strategy.},

To mitigate such impact, energy storage systems ({ESSs}) and photovoltaic ({PV}) are usually installed in the {EB} transit centers ({EBTCs}). In this article, a threelayer stochastic energy management approach is proposed for {EBTCs} to reduce the operation cost while maintaining local voltage quality. In the ﬁrst layer, a modiﬁed robust optimization over time ({ROOT}) approach is developed to obtain the charging/discharging margin with minimum {EBTC} operation cost. In the second layer, the voltage regulation impact on the local voltage quality is estimated through power ﬂow analysis considering voltage ﬂuctuation and line loss minimization. In the third layer, the charging/discharging strategy is optimized with dynamic programming based on a modiﬁed greedy algorithm. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated in a case study based on the {IEEE} 123-bus test feeder and the real operation data obtained from St. Albert Transit in Alberta, Canada. The results indicate that the proposed approach can not only minimize the {EBTC} operation cost but also well maintain the local voltage quality, in comparison with existing energy management approaches.},
